# Problem Statement
Hotels regularly run discount campaigns to attract customers, but not every discount strategy is effective. Some discounts lead to substantial room bookings, while others reduce revenue without increasing occupancy.
Your challenge is to analyze hotel reservation snapshots and identify the most effective discount strategies across different hotels, dates, and star ratings.
# Tasks
# Discount Effectiveness
Analyze which discount codes result in the largest booking potential (reduction in available rooms).

# Price Elasticity Modeling
Build models to estimate the relationship between discount percentage and available rooms.
Identify “sweet spots” where discounts maximize bookings without unnecessary revenue loss.

# Hotel Segmentation
Cluster hotels based on price levels, discount strategies, and star ratings.
Identify segments like “Luxury Hotels that rarely discount” vs. “Mid-range hotels that aggressively discount.”
